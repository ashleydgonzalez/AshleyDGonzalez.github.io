      <h1>Hi everyone, I'm Ashley</h1>
<!-- Used h1 since this header is the most important -->
      <p>I am a Software Engineering student living in California.</p>
      <p>As a former Clinical Research Coordinator, I enjoy working with others and the importance of team collaboration as well as making sure web pages are up to date with important information. </p>
      <p>Some of my other interests include:</p>
        <ul>
<!-- Used unorganized lists since there is no particular order to the two list items-->
          <li>Spending time outside,</li>
          <li>And doing anything creative, from knitting to creating web pages!</li>
        </ul>

    <!--About Me-->
    <article>
<!-- Used article container to group About Me section container so it's easier to read -->
      <h2 class="bordertop">About Ashley</h2>
<!-- Used h2 since this header is still important, but not as important as h1 -->
<!-- Used paragraphs to give a brief description of my life after college and how I ended up where I am today and my why -->
        <p>After graduating college in the Bay Area, I held several jobs in the psychology field, before ultimately spending a few years in Clinical Research. After some time, I wanted to do more in developing informational web sites to direct people to life changing studies to deliver the best care.</p>
      
      <p>As a student at Thinkful, I have started my journey to become a Software Engineer to develop the skills needed to deliver these sites that people can easily access, and I am so excited!</p>

      <p>If you are looking to hire a Software Engineer to develop these web pages, or to create front-end or back-end software for emerging tech research studies, please contact me!</p>
