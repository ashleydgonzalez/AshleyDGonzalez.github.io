        <ul>
          <li>Spending time outside</li>
          <li>And doing anything creative, from knitting to creating web pages!</li>

    <!--About Me-->
    <article>
      <h2 class="bordertop">About Ashley</h2>
        <p>After graduating college in the Bay Area, I held several jobs in the psychology field, before ultimately spending a few years in Clinical Research. After some time, I wanted to do more in developing informational web sites to direct people to life changing studies to deliver the best care.</p>
      
      <p>As a student at Thinkful, I have started my journey to become a Software Engineer to develop the skills needed to deliver these sites that people can easily access, and I am so excited!</p>

      <p>If you are looking to hire a Software Engineer to develop these web pages, or to create front-end or back-end software for emerging tech research studies, please contact me!</p>
